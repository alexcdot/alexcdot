I'm the CTO and co-founder of [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me). We are [hiring](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/GPTZero)!

Previously, I was a research scientist at Waabi, building autonomous trucks. I finished my master's in CS, dropped out of my PhD at University of Toronto, and I studied Computer Science and Data Science at Caltech. <br/>
